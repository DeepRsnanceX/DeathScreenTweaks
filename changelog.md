- Rebrand to DeathScreenTweaks for consistency with LoadingScreenTweaks and EndscreenTweaks.
- Automatic migration of custom death messages from DisturbingNewBests.
- Rewrote a few config descriptions.
- Added option to hide the New Best screen itself, because that was apparently an attempted mod submission on the old Geode mod index.
## v1.2.0

## v1.1.2
- Replaced a few quotes in the default set in light of recent events.
- Replaced a few quotes in the Brandon Rogers set, because some of them were incredibly unfunny.

## v1.1.0
- Added linewrapping support. Thanks sofabeddd!
- Added option to hide rewards animation on death.
- Added "Max Scale" option.
- *Technically*, this is the initial release for the Geode index, but there have been several notable changes between v1.0.0 and v1.1.0 that it's best to release a new version now to make sure everyone updates to this version.
## v1.0.0
- Initial release (for GitHub).
