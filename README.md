# DisturbingNewBests

Replaces "New Best" messages with slightly "better" ones, including those of your own choice.

Allows three sets of messages: a default set, custom text from the config folder, and (ad-friendly) Brandon Rogers quotes.

Custom messages defined from the `custom.txt` file within the mod's config directory will be formatted as follows: `- lorem ipsum -` in order to distinguish them from the default set of messages.

As tempting as it would be to have a regex filter to moderate messages found in `custom.txt`, this mod will not be pulling double duty by attempting to solve the Scunthorpe problem.

Quotes originated from a variety of sources, including various members of the Geode SDK Discord server, Brandon Rogers, and Adam Neylan.

Logo contributions by sofabedd.

Level featured in `logo.png` and `demoOne.png`: Unnamed 84 by 4y4.

Built-in quotes moderated by CatXus and alk.

Original mod idea by @goose_jpg from Twitter.

This Geode mod is licensed under LGPLv2, and is unavailable for macOS.
