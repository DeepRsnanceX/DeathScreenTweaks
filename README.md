# DeathScreenTweaks

Note: This mod *will* auto-enable the `"Just, Don't..."`/`"Do Not..."` in-game setting; it is necessary for this mod's most important feature (read below) to have a visible effect.

Various tweaks to the "New Best" screen. (Formerly DisturbingNewBests.)

Replaces "New Best" messages with slightly "better" ones, including those of your own choice.

Allows three sets of messages: a default set, custom text from the config folder, and (ad-friendly) Brandon Rogers quotes.

Custom messages defined from the `custom.txt` file within the mod's config directory will be formatted as follows: `- lorem ipsum -` in order to distinguish them from the default set of messages.

As tempting as it would be to have a regex filter to moderate messages found in `custom.txt`, this mod will not be pulling double duty by attempting to solve the Scunthorpe problem.

Quotes originated from a variety of sources, including various members of the Geode SDK Discord server, xkcd, [Brandon Rogers](https://linktr.ee/brandonbored), and Adam Neylan.

Logo contributions and text linewrapping support by [sofabeddd](https://gdbrowser.com/u/7976112).
